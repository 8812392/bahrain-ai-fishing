st.title("🎣 My Story: Why Fishing Matters to Me")

st.write("""
Fishing has always been more than just a hobby for me — it’s a connection to the sea, 
to Bahrain’s culture, and to moments of peace and reflection.

Growing up, fishing taught me patience, respect for nature, and responsibility.
Over time, I started noticing how different fishing methods can either protect
marine life or seriously harm it.

That’s why I created this project — to combine my love for fishing with technology,
and to help people understand the difference between **sustainable** and 
**unsustainable** fishing practices.
